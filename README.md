# darksast SAST Scanner

JavaScript-Security-Scanner is a lightweight Go-based static scanner for application and configuration code. It supports JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, PHP, Ruby, C#, Bash, and YAML scanning, reports findings in JSON/CSV, and exports package inventory, framework summaries, and compromised-package intel matches.

## Features

- Multi-language SAST scanning for JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, PHP, Ruby, C#, Bash, and YAML (`.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`, `.py`, `.go`, `.rs`, `.java`, `.php`, `.rb`, `.cs`, `.sh`, `.bash`, `.zsh`, `.yaml`, `.yml`).
- Tree-sitter-based YAML rule engine with support for:
  - Native repo rules in `rules/`.
  - Semgrep/OpenGrep `rules: [...]` bundles when each imported rule provides a Tree-sitter-compatible `query` (or `metadata.query`).
  - Optional rule language targeting, dependency-aware rule gating (`requires_dependency` + `-gate-by-dependency`), and confidence/severity reporting.
  - Optional post-match false-positive controls (literal gates, regex require/ignore filters, argument-count gates) and taint-aware matching.
- Rich findings pipeline:
  - Output formats: JSON, CSV, optional SARIF.
  - Precise spans (`line/column/end_line/end_column`) plus `snippet`, `matched_code`, and `highlighted_snippet`.
  - Rule-level `tags` in findings output to support grouping by sensitive-data and secret-related detections.
  - Framework/severity rollups via findings framework summary CSV.
  - Severity/confidence result gating via `-min-severity` and `-min-confidence`.
  - Optional category-based CI fail gating via `-fail-on-categories`.
- Dependency intelligence pipeline:
  - Package inventory extraction across manifests including `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `go.mod`, and `Cargo.toml`.
  - npm lockfile-aware resolution from `package-lock.json` / `npm-shrinkwrap.json`.
  - Inventory outputs: text table + CSV + summary CSV.
  - Compromised package detection from local seed rules plus optional remote feed (with generated merged rules output).
  - OSS advisory matching from local bundles plus optional remote feed, including `github://<ecosystem>` ingestion from GitHub Advisory Database.
  - Advisory policy suppressions with optional expiry and CI fail gating via `-fail-on-oss-vuln-severity`.
- Sensitive-data inventory ("data map"):
  - Independent pass that classifies occurrences of common sensitive data types (Personal, Financial, Health, Authentication, Technical) across source and config files, regardless of whether a vulnerability rule fires.
  - Detector-based: pattern matches on identifier names (e.g. `email`, `ssn`, `creditCardNumber`) and literal value shapes (RFC-5322-ish email, US SSN, IPv4, IBAN, JWT, MAC, card PAN ranges, etc.).
  - Outputs: JSON (`-data-inventory-json-out`), per-occurrence CSV (`-data-inventory-csv-out`), aggregated summary CSV grouped by `(category, data_type, severity)` (`-data-inventory-summary-csv-out`).
  - Honors `-include-tests`, `-include-vendored`, and `-changed-files` so the inventory pass tracks the SAST pipeline's file selection.
  - Toggle with `-enable-data-inventory` (default `true`).
- Optional URL fetch mode (`-url`) that downloads inline and same-origin external scripts into `-fetch-out` and scans them with the same pipeline.
- Scan scope controls for test/spec and vendored/build-output files via `-include-tests` and `-include-vendored`.
- Windows-first PowerShell entry scripts plus cross-platform shell entrypoint and npm wrappers.

## Requirements

- Go 1.26+
- `gcc` available on PATH (required for cgo + Tree-sitter)
- PowerShell 5.1+ on Windows (for `.ps1` entry scripts)

```

### Scan a live website

The scanner can also fetch JavaScript directly from a URL. When `-url` is set, it downloads inline `<script>` blocks and (by default) same-origin external `<script src="...">` files into `-fetch-out`, writes a `manifest.json` mapping each saved file back to its origin URL, and then runs the normal scan pipeline against that directory.

```bash
CC=gcc go run ./cmd/scanner/main.go \
  -url https://example.com/ \
  -fetch-out ./fetched-site \
  -rules ./rules
```

Relevant flags:

| `-fetch-user-agent` | scanner UA | `User-Agent` header sent on each request. |
| `-fetch-max-bytes` | `5242880` (5 MiB) | Maximum bytes accepted per response; larger responses are skipped. |
| `-fetch-same-origin` | `true` | When `true`, skip external scripts whose host differs from the page URL. |

| `-advisory-rules` | `./intel/advisories.yaml` | Local YAML/JSON advisory bundle for OSS dependency vulnerability matching. |
| `-advisory-feed-url` | (empty) | Optional remote JSON feed for OSS dependency advisories. Use `github://npm`, `github://pip`, `github://go`, `github://cargo`, or `github://all` to ingest GitHub Advisory Database data for supported scanner ecosystems. |
| `-advisory-generated-rules-out` | (empty) | Optional YAML path to write the merged advisory ruleset. |
| `-advisory-policy` | (empty) | Optional YAML policy file with `ignores:` entries keyed by advisory ID, package, and optional expiry. |
| `-oss-vulns-json-out` | `./oss_vulnerabilities.json` | JSON report for OSS dependency vulnerability matches. |

| `-fail-on-new-findings` | `false` | Exit non-zero when at least one finding remains after baseline filtering. Combine with `-baseline` to gate CI only on net-new findings. |
| `-changed-files` | (empty) | Newline-delimited file (typically `git diff --name-only`) restricting the scan to listed paths while still loading full project dependency context. |
| `-enable-data-inventory` | `true` | Run the sensitive-data inventory pass and emit a Bearer-style data map. Set to `false` to skip. |
| `-data-inventory-json-out` | `./data_inventory.json` | JSON report listing every detected sensitive-data occurrence plus category/data-type/file rollups. Empty string disables. |

Notes and limitations:

- Only the single page at `-url` is fetched; the scanner does not crawl additional pages.
- JavaScript injected at runtime by other scripts (for example via `document.write` or SPA hydration) is not captured because no headless browser is used.
- Same-origin filtering is on by default to avoid persisting third-party CDN code; pass `-fetch-same-origin=false` to include it.
- The default User-Agent identifies the scanner so site operators can see what is hitting them.
- For GitHub Advisory Database coverage mapped to scanner-supported ecosystems, set `-advisory-feed-url` to one of: `github://npm`, `github://pip`, `github://go`, `github://cargo`, or `github://all`.
- `github://cargo` pulls GitHub `rust` advisories and maps them to the scanner's `cargo` ecosystem for matching.
- For higher API limits on large pulls, set `GITHUB_TOKEN` (or `GH_TOKEN`) in the environment.

### Dependency-aware inventory and findings

- Package inventory now records declared versions, resolved versions, and the lockfile source when available.
- Findings output distinguishes `code` findings from `dependency` findings.
- Enriched rule metadata such as category, taxonomy, CWE, OWASP, references, remediation, and confidence rationale is surfaced in JSON and CSV findings output when present.

### Finding location fields

Every finding now includes precise source location information:

| Field      | Description                                                |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `file`     | Path to the source file containing the vulnerability       |
| `line`     | 1-based line number within the file                        |
| `column`   | 1-based column (character offset) on that line             |
| `snippet`  | Trimmed text of the source line (capped at 120 characters) |
| `matched_code` | Exact AST-matched code fragment that triggered the rule |
| `highlighted_snippet` | Snippet with `[[DANGEROUS]]...[[/DANGEROUS]]` markers around the matched fragment |

**Console output** prints `file:line:col` followed by highlighted dangerous code on the next line:

```
[!] HIGH     | JavaScript   | JS-EVAL-EXEC                 | src/app.js:14:1
    [[DANGEROUS]]eval(userInput)[[/DANGEROUS]];
```

**JSON findings** include these location/context fields per entry:

```json
{
  "file": "src/app.js",
  "line": 14,
  "column": 1,
  "rule_id": "JS-EVAL-EXEC",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "framework": "JavaScript",
  "snippet": "eval(userInput);",
  "matched_code": "eval(userInput)",
  "highlighted_snippet": "[[DANGEROUS]]eval(userInput)[[/DANGEROUS]];"
}
```

**CSV findings** (`findings.csv`) include `snippet`, `matched_code`, and `highlighted_snippet` columns for faster triage.

### Fingerprints, baselines, and diff mode

Each finding now carries a deterministic `fingerprint` (rule ID + relative file + matched code + neighbor-line context) that is line-number independent so trivial refactors do not invalidate suppressions. The fingerprint is emitted in `findings_report.json`, in the trailing `fingerprint` column of `findings.csv`, and as `partialFingerprints["darksast/v1"]` in SARIF output.

- `-baseline-out baseline.json` writes the current run's fingerprints; commit the file to "bless" existing debt.
- `-baseline baseline.json` filters out any finding whose fingerprint is listed before reports and exit-gating run.
- `-fail-on-new-findings` exits non-zero when at least one finding remains after baseline filtering — ideal for PR CI.
- `-changed-files diff.txt` scopes the code scan to a newline-delimited list of paths (e.g. `git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD`). Dependency / SCA analysis still loads the full project so taint and advisory matching remain accurate.

### Inline suppression directives

Annotate a finding inline with either of two equivalent comment prefixes:

- `// scanner-disable-line [RULE-ID[,RULE-ID...]]` — suppress matching rules on the same line.
- `// scanner-disable-next-line [RULE-ID[,RULE-ID...]]` — suppress matching rules on the following line.
- `// scanner-expected [RULE-ID[,RULE-ID...]]` and `// scanner-expected-next-line [RULE-ID[,RULE-ID...]]` — semantic synonyms for the two above, meant for findings you have reviewed and chosen to accept (for example in deliberately vulnerable fixtures).

Omitting the rule ID list suppresses any finding on that line.
